# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Overview
For this project, we use the [Human Activity Recognition Using
Smartphones Data
Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
The data set was obtained from experiments that were conducted with a
group of 30 volunteers when they performed six activities (WALKING,
WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING)
while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II).  The embedded
accelerometer and gyroscope in the smartphone recorded the 3-axial
linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity.  More details can be
found in the `README.txt` file in the [data
set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The goal of the project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
